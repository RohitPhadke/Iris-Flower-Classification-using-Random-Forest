# Iris-Flower-Classification-using-Random-Forest
The aim is to classify iris flowers among three species (setosa, versicolor or virginica) from measurements of length and width of sepals and petals.
The iris data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.
The central goal here is to design a model which makes good classifications for new flowers or, in other words, one which exhibits good generalization
